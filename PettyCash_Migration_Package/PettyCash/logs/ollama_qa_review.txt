OLLAMA REVIEW OF SYSTEM LOGIC Q&A
========================================

After analyzing the Q&A file, I have identified several areas that are critical for building a complete system, which are missing or could be more specific and detailed. Here are my suggestions:

**Critical Missing Questions:**

1. **Data Validation:** What validation rules should be applied to ensure data integrity? For example, how will the system validate that amounts are within expected ranges or that dates are valid?
2. **Error Handling:** How will the system handle errors that occur during processing, such as network timeouts or API quota errors? Should there be a retry mechanism or error reporting features?
3. **Security and Access Control:** What security measures should be implemented to ensure data access and authorization? Are there any specific authentication requirements or service account files needed?
4. **Performance Optimization:** How will the system optimize performance for large datasets or high-volume processing? Should there be mechanisms for caching, batch processing, or parallelization?
5. **Audit Trails and Logging:** What audit trails and logging features should be implemented to track changes, errors, and system activity?

**Specificity and Detail:**

1. **Target Cell Finding Logic:** How will the system determine which target cells are relevant to a given transaction? Should there be rules for handling multiple transactions with the same date/header combination?
2. **JGD Truth Rule Management:** What specific rules should be implemented in JGD Truth, such as partial matching for source names or exact matches?
3. **Data Reference and Lookup:** How will the system reference existing data in target sheets? Should there be mechanisms for validating that target headers exist before processing?

**Edge Cases and Scenarios:**

1. **Empty Spreadsheets:** What should happen if a spreadsheet is empty or contains only blank rows?
2. **Invalid Data:** How will the system handle invalid data, such as non-numeric amounts or invalid dates?
3. **Duplicate Transactions:** How will the system handle duplicate transactions with different headers or amounts?

**Technical Implementation Details:**

1. **API Integration:** What APIs should be integrated to interact with external systems, and how will authentication and authorization be handled?
2. **Database Schema:** What database schema should be used to store data, and how will it be optimized for performance?
3. **Data Formats:** Which data formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) should be supported, and how will they be converted between formats?

**Business Logic and Workflow Steps:**

1. **Transaction Processing:** What specific steps should occur during transaction processing, such as validating amounts or checking for duplicate transactions?
2. **JGD Truth Rule Application:** How will the system apply JGD Truth rules to determine which target cells are relevant to a given transaction?
3. **Target Sheet Updates:** What updates should be made to target sheets after a transaction has been processed?

To address these areas, I suggest adding the following questions:

1. Q101: What validation rules should be applied to ensure data integrity?
2. Q102: How will the system handle errors that occur during processing, such as network timeouts or API quota errors?
3. Q103: What security measures should be implemented to ensure data access and authorization?
4. Q104: How will the system optimize performance for large datasets or high-volume processing?
5. Q105: What audit trails and logging features should be implemented to track changes, errors, and system activity?

These questions can help provide more clarity on specific implementation details, technical requirements, and business logic, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the Petty Cash Sorter system's architecture.
